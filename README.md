# hello-world
Fuel Cell Scientist moving onto programming and blockchain, hopefully.
Additionally, I love literature and playing music when the wave of creativity hits me.
I also do yoga quiet regularly and love hitting the punching bag (although this sometimes tenses my wrists).
Nothing is more important than checking in on the narratives me tell ourselves each and every day, imo.
